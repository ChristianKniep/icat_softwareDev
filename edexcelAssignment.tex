{\center \section*{NOTES TO STUDENTS}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Check carefully the submission date and the instructions given the assignment. Late assignments will not be accepted.
    \item Ensure that you give yourself enough time to complete the assignment by the due date.
    \item Do not leave things such as printing to the last minute – excuse of this nature will not be accepted for failure to hand in the work on time.
    \item You must take responsibility for managing your own time effectively.
    \item If you are unable to hand in your assignment on time and have valid reason such as illness, you may apply (in writing) for extension.
    \item Failure to achieve PASS grade will results in REFERRAL grade being given
    \item Take great care that if you use other people’s work or ideas in your assignment, you probably reference them in your report.
    \item \textbf{NOTE : if you are caught cheated, you could have your grade reduced to zero, or at worst, you could be excluded from the course.}
\end{itemize}
{\center \section*{GRADING}}
\subsection*{Pass}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item All criteria identified in the assignment are met. 
    \item The deadline to submit the design and final report have been met.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection*{Merit}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Write the points to meet the merit criteria
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Distinction}

{\center \section*{SCENARIO}}
This would be the 'product concept catalogue' you get from the customer and to which will be referenced during this course.
\subsection{Resource Monitoring Management}
\paragraph{Intention}
We would like to put in place a service which provided an unspecified user
the capability of getting Information about resources he usualy can not interact with.
\paragraph{functional requirement}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The user has to use a commandline-tool to get the information from the deamon,
          such as: \code{./infoClient getResourceXY}
    \item If there are serveral different daemons on one or more machines,
          it has to be possible to select one.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Non-functional requirement}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Usability} It should be easy to use even for an user who has no further IT-experience
    \item \textbf{Reliability} It should be a stable, easy to maintain and reliable system
    \item \textbf{Expendability} New features should be easy to implement in the software 
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Information gathering}
To gather information we should have a dedicated software-piece to place it
within the resource-area where it is supposed to gather information.
\paragraph{Resources}
The software should include at least five resources in the monitoring system.
Since our employees are not that big in computers you may offer us some possible
resource information you have in mind. Maybe including these areas of interest:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Filesystem} Maybe free space, occupied space, swap used, etc.
    \item \textbf{Network} Internet available, ping time, ...
    \item \textbf{OS} What OS is running, some configurations
\end{itemize}
